# wynn spell macro

macro for spells
this mod inputs spells for you when you click on keybinds (no this isn't auto you can't use it to input spells on a loop) also this isn't finished, currently only works with shaman class, also yes this is allowed on wynncraft, DO NOT USE ON SERVERS OTHER THAN WYNNCRAFT.


# DO NO OPEN CHESTS WHILE HOLDING WEAPON AS THAT COULD REGISTER AS A SPELL FOR THE MOD
there are two keybinds (the interact with block beybind - default: right click) and the other one ... if you tap right click while holding a weapon, it inputs r - r - r, if you hold the right click it inputs r - r - l, if you tap the other keybind (default: q-make sure your drop item key is not q), it inputs r - l - r, if you hold the keybind, it inputs r - l - l this allows for generally less clunky spell input with only 2 keybinds.
